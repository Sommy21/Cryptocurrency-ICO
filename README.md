# Cryptocurrency-ICO
We all have bank accounts and we do use them frequently especially during the current COVID-19
situation. But do you remember how much of stress you went through when you were opening a new
Bank account or arguing with the higher authorities over the phone?
What if there was a way to still send and receive money but without any of the hassles? Yes, and the
answer to this is Cryptocurrency, and that’s exactly what we are trying to do. To relieve people from
this headache of banks and a centralized authority over them, we are creating our own Cryptocurrency
- VIT token.
In this project, we plan to develop our cryptocurrency using Solidity, an object-oriented programming
language, for writing Smart Contracts.
Our currency will be complying with the ERC-20 Token Standard provided by Ethereum.
Once the Smart contract is in place, our Backend team will become proactive and start creating APIs
for the transactions that will take place.
Side by Side, our Frontend web developers will be working on the UI/UX which will allow end-users
to buy and interact with VIT token smoothly without any hassle. They’ll be using a Technology Stack
of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.
Once both Backend, as well as the Frontend, run individually smoothly, we will start integrating both
of them.
Meanwhile, our Documentation team will be working on providing a transparent guide on how to
interact efficiently with VIT token.
We plan to host our website on GitHub as of now but we are still looking for a possibility of
purchasing a domain.
Since we want this to be as transparent as possible, we will be Open Sourcing our code completely
so that people can have a look at it anytime and our fellow developers can help us make it better over
time and be a part of this revolution.
By the end of our project, VIT token will be hosting its ICO (Initial Coin Offering) on our webpage.
